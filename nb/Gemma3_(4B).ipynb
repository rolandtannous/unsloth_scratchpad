To calculate the modulus of two given numbers, you can use the modulus operator in the following way:\\n\\n```python\\n# Calculate the modulus\\nModulus = a % b\\n\\nprint(\"Modulus of the given numbers is: \", Modulus)\\n```\\n\\nIn this code snippet, the variables \\'a\\' and \\'b\\' represent the two given numbers for which you want to calculate the modulus. By using the modulus operator \\'%\\', we calculate the remainder when \\'a\\' is divided by \\'b\\'. The result is then stored in the variable \\'Modulus\\'. Finally, the modulus value is printed using the \\'print\\' statement.\\n\\nFor example, if \\'a\\' is 10 and \\'b\\' is 4, the modulus calculation would be 10 % 4, which equals 2. Therefore, the output of the above code would be:\\n\\n```\\nModulus of the given numbers is: 2\\n```\\n\\nThis means that the modulus of 10 and 4 is 2.',\n",
